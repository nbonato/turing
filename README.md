# Turing Institute digital residency
This is the repository for the [Living with Machines digital residency](https://livingwithmachines.ac.uk/digital-residencies/) offered by the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/work-turing/living-machines-open-call-digital-residencies). I submitted my proposal in April 2023 and in May I was informed that it was accepted by the institute. After some issues with the paperwork, mostly connected to insurance requirements, I started working on it officially in late June.

The proposal was to create a webapp to illustrate the content of the [PressDirectories dataset](https://github.com/Living-with-machines/PressDirectories), plotting the data on a map of the United Kingdom that changes across the decades spanned by the dataset.
